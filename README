Project 3 - Turing Machine Simulator
Author: Abdulalim Ciftci

1. Description
---------------------------
This is a Turing Machine simulator for CS 361. The program reads a file 
(like file2.txt), loads the states and runs the simulation. 
Finally, it prints the visited parts of the tape.

2. Files
---------------------------
- tm/TMSimulator.java: The main class. It reads the input file.
- tm/TM.java: The logic of the machine (tape and head).
- tm/TMState.java: This class holds the transition rules.

3. How to Compile and Run
---------------------------
You need to be in the main project folder.

To compile:
javac tm/*.java

To run:
java tm.TMSimulator file2.txt
java tm.TMSimulator file5.txt

4. Implementation
---------------------------
I used a HashMap for the tape because the tape can go to negative numbers. 
Also, HashMap is faster than ArrayList for this project. 
For the transitions, I used normal arrays inside the states because 
it is simple and works fast.
The simulation stops when the machine reaches the halting state.
